🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning
This repository contains a deep learning-based project for detecting brain tumors from MRI scan images. The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify MRI images into tumor and no-tumor categories with high accuracy.

🚀 Features
Trained on a labeled dataset of brain MRI scans (JPG format)

Uses data augmentation and image preprocessing

Built using TensorFlow / Keras

Transfer Learning with pretrained CNNs (e.g., ResNet50)

Handles class imbalance using class weights

Web interface for predictions (optional: Streamlit / Flask)

Real-time predictions from uploaded MRI images



🧪 Model Details
Architecture: VGG-16 (pretrained on ImageNet)

Optimizer: Adam Optimizer

Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Regularization: Dropout, Batch Normalization

Data Augmentation: Rotation, Zoom, Flip, etc.
