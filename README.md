ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning
This repository contains a deep learning-based project for detecting brain tumors from MRI scan images. The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify MRI images into tumor and no-tumor categories with high accuracy.

ðŸš€ Features
Trained on a labeled dataset of brain MRI scans (JPG format)

Uses data augmentation and image preprocessing

Built using TensorFlow / Keras

Transfer Learning with pretrained CNNs (e.g., ResNet50)

Handles class imbalance using class weights

Web interface for predictions (optional: Streamlit / Flask)

Real
